Download	the	two	data	files from	this	Moodle	“Assignment”.		
They	are	called	“co2_hawaii.txt”	and	“co2_alaska.txt”.		
These	files	are	from	the	U.S.	National	Oceanic	and	Atmospheric	Administration(NOAA).		
They	contain	over	40	years	of	measurements	of	carbon	dioxide	levels	(CO2)	in	the	
atmosphere,	taken	from	instruments	at	Barrow,	Alaska	and	Mauna	Loa,	Hawaii.
Use	a	text	editor	to	view	and	familiarize	yourself	with their contents	and	format,	but	make	sure	you	do	
not	modify	the	input	files.		
There	are	detailed	comments	in the	data files	explaining	the	meaning	of	each	column	in	the	data.


You can find the files co2_hawaii and co2_alaska in the code itself.
